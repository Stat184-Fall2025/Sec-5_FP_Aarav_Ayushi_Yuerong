# Airport departure delay rate investigation of NYC

Air travel delays are a common concern for passengers flying in and out of New York City. Using the nycflights23 dataset, this project investigates departure delay rates at NYC’s three major airports—JFK, LGA, and EWR—with a particular focus on modeling how often flights departing from JFK in 2023 were on time.

## Overview

As residents on the East Coast, many of us travel domestically and internationally through New York City airports, and we agree that understanding patterns in flight departure delays is both practically useful for arranging travel plans and statistically interesting. In this project, we analyze flight data from 2023 to study departure times and delay rates for NYC’s three major airports using data cleansing, summarization, and visualization techniques learned throughout the course.

We begin by creating a clean, tidied version of the nycflights23 flights dataset preloaded in R, focusing on variables such as airport origin and departure delay. Using this refined dataset, we construct summary tables that report delay rates and on-time departure percentages for each airport as well as for NYC overall. To further explore these patterns, we plan to create a well-annotated bar plot and scatter plot that visualize differences in delay rates across airports and trends in departure delays over time.

Through this analysis, the project aims to provide an accessible, data-driven overview of how frequently flights depart on time—particularly from JFK—while helping potential passengers in this class better understand historical delay patterns at NYC airports.

### Interesting Insight (To be added)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

Data comes from the nycflights23 package preloaded in R It contains several data sets, but only data from the flights dataset will be used. 

## Current Plan

1. Data Analysis:

a. data wrangling and cleaning, remove errors or missing values.

b. transforming the data into a tidy version

c. conduct a summary table to help group members have a better understanding of the overall situation and decide a more specific direction of future investigation

2. Data Visualization: developing professional-looking tables that are readable to unprofessionals or passengers, helping them to understand the situation of flight delays over 20 minutes (might be subject to change in the future), and plots/graphs(a bar plot and scatterplot) that make it clear for anybody to understand the information we extracted from this data.

3. Review and polish the process after the main body is done.

a. Add notation, caption, and glyphs to the graph to make it brief and readable

b. Point out if we used CARE or FAIR principles of DATA.

c. Discuss with group members and polish parts that can be improved

4. Effectively using GitHub: Use functions on GitHub such as push and README to work as a group, as a simulation of future collaboration in career. This will be very important for us as we upload; we will all dedicate ourselves and work on different parts of the project.

5. Compile and review the full draft together, and review if any improvements and polish can be made.

6. Prepare a reproducible data report and brief PPT to demonstrate to the class.
